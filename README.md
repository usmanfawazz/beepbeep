The initial idea is to use the microphone to listen for the "beeps" from a glider vario whilst in flight.  When we detect the beeps (and their intensity), we snap the GPS coordinates.   We then add them to a moving map (maybe a pin with intensity).

Then, during the flight, a pilot can return to the source of lift.   If we download them, we can build a viewable or downloadable map of lift that was found on previous flights.
